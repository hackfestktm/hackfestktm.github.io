## Prerequisites

- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)

If you don't yet have nodejs installed and you are running mac os, I suggest using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (node version manger), which makes managing different node versions a breeze.

## Usage

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone
```

Cd into the project folder

Install yarn modules

```bash
yarn install (if you have not installed yarn then: brew install yarn)
```

Build production

```bash
yarn build
```

Build version is available in `build` folder.

## Development

### Server

For development you can use:

```bash
yarn start
```

This brings up demo website on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
